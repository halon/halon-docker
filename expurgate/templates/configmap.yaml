    ### Section 1.  General program configuration
    #
    # The directives in this section affect the overall operation of the
    # eXpurgate Spamd.
    #
    <General>
        #
        # WorkingDirectory: The eXpurgate Spamd spool directory.
        #
        # note: This directive is required, but may be specified on the
        #       command line instead.
        #
        # Default: none
        WorkingDirectory "/var/spool/expurgate-spamd"

        #
        # LicenseFile: The filename of the eXpurgate license key.
        #
        # note: This directive is required, but may be specified on the
        #       command line instead.
        #
        # Default: none
        LicenseFile "/etc/expurgate-spamd/client.key"

        #
        # SubLicenseFile: If specified, indicates the name of a file
        # containing the eXpurgate sublicense key.
        #
        # Default: none
        #SubLicenseFile "/etc/expurgate-spamd/client.subkey"

        #
        # SubLicense: If specified, indicates the eXpurgate sublicense key
        # as a quoted string.
        #
        # Default: none
        #SubLicense "this-string-contains-a-sublicense-key"

        #
        # Daemonize: Specify true to start the eXpurgate Spamd in the background
        # as a daemon.
        #
        # note: This directive is ignored when eXpurgate is started using
        #       the distributed startup scripts.
        #
        # Default: no
        Daemonize yes

        #
        # Changeroot: If specified, change the root directory to the
        # given directory before startup.
        #
        # note: This directive typically requires the application to be
        #       started with root privileges (on Linux, the process must
        #       have the CAP_SYS_CHROOT capability). Use the UserId
        #       directive to release these privileges after startup.
        #
        # Default: none
        #Changeroot "/var/spool/changeroot"

        #
        # Pidfile: If specified, write the process identifier of the
        # running application to the file specified.
        #
        # note: This directive is ignored when eXpurgate is started using
        #       the distributed startup scripts.
        #
        # Default: none
        #Pidfile "/var/run/expurgate-spamd.pid"

        #
        # UserId: If specified, change the effective user and group ID
        # to the given values after startup.
        #
        # note: The user ID may be either a user name or a numeric user
        #       ID. It may be followed by a colon and a group ID (group
        #       name or numeric group ID) with no spaces in between.
        #       The user ID field may be left empty. Specification of a
        #       group ID is mandatory if a trailing colon is left past
        #       the user ID.
        #
        # Default: none
        #UserId mail:mail

        #
        # Product feature configuration subsection.
        #

        # features.
        #
        <ProductFeatures>
            #
            # Feature: Activate or deactivate a product feature.
            #
            # note: The set of default features is determined by the license
            #       key. The 'phishing' feature depends on the 'spam'
            #       feature but is independent from the license permissions.
            #
            #Feature Spam     on

    ### Section 2.  Logging configuration
    #
    # This section specifies the log levels at which log messages should
    # be produced, and the targets to which the log messages should be
    # written.
    #
    # The log levels are given below in ascending order of severity:
    #
    #   1. DEBUG        debug-level messages
    #   2. INFO         informational messages
    #   3. NOTICE       normal, but significant, information
    #   4. WARNING      warning condition
    #   5. ERROR        error condition (recoverable)
    #   6. CRITICAL     critical condition
    #   7. ALERT        alert! action must be taken immediately
    #   8. EMERGENCY    emergency! system is unusable
    #
    # If the application detects that a log target is unavailable, it will
    # remove the log target and issue an error message on any remaining
    # log targets.
    #
    # Please note, that all logging is turned off by default.
    <Logging>
        #
        # DefaultTimestamp: The format of the timestamp for FileLog or ConsoleLog can be
        # specified in a strftime() compatible notation. The global Timestamp option is
        # valid for all FileLog or ConsoleLog entries which has no Timestamp option
        # specified.
        #
        #DefaultTimestamp "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

        #
        # SysLog: If specified, write log messages in the given range to

        # Optionally the format of the timestamps can be specified in strftime()
        # compatible notation.
        #
        # note: If the file does not exist, it will be created when the
        #       first log message is produced. If the file does exist, it
        #       is appended to and must be writable by the user as which
        #       the Spamd server is running (see UserId directive).
        #
        FileLog NOTICE-EMERGENCY "/var/log/expurgate-spamd/expurgate-spamd.log" timestamp "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

        # to the system console (see console(4)).
        # Optionally the format of the timestamps can be specified in strftime()
        # compatible notation.
        #
        #ConsoleLog EMERGENCY timestamp "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

        #
        # ErrorLog: If specified, write log messages in the given range
        # to the standard error stream.
        #
        # note: If the Daemonize directive is used, the standard error
        #       stream is closed after startup and will be unavailable
        #       for logging.
        #
        #ErrorLog ALERT-EMERGENCY

        #
        # Subsection Messages.  Customize log messages.
        #
        # This subsection contains format strings for customized log
        # messages. A format string may refer to run-time variables by
        # enclosing them in parentheses preceded by a percent-sign,
        # e.g. `%(varname)'.

        #
        # Hostname: SPAMD hostname, defaults to `localhost' if not set.
        #
        # note: This domain is used to complete the username sent
        #       via the Spam Assassin protocol's ``user'' header field to
        #       an e-mail address - and finally set the `RCPT TO' information

        # MaxContentLength: Accept messages up to this size limit as reported

        # Default: 0 = unlimited
        #MaxContentLength 100000
    </Spamd>

        #       directive indicates whether eXpurgate Spamd should respond
